<h1 id="data-sciences-practicum">Data Sciences Practicum</h1>
<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>A practical introduction to contemporary data analysis with a focus on improving programming literacy, research workflow, and reproducibility. A majority of the workload is designed to complement and advance the student's current research. Covers programming basics, exploratory data analysis, and common modeling tasks using the <em>R</em> programming language. Introduces cutting-edge data science concepts, including distributed version control, the grammar of graphics, and dynamic documents. Rather than focusing on the particulars of the language, learning objectives are targeted toward building the familiarity and confidence necessary for future self-study.</p>

<h2 id="sessions">Sessions</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 Weekly Sessions
<ul>
<li>3 Hours In Length</li>
<li>First 1.5 Hours of Instruction</li>
<li>Final 1.5 hours are optional, and serve as open office hours with instructor and collaboration with classmates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-notes">Course Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course notes</strong> will be published online in both HTML and PDF format, at least one week prior to the relevent session</li>
<li>Course notes will provide <strong>explicit examples for the basic concepts</strong> students are expected to be familiar with, and <strong>vetted online references for advanced</strong> concepts which may be helpful to their particular research</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Weekly review exercises</strong> of less than 2 hours in length will be assigned. They will be relevant to the course notes of the particular week. Some of these exercises will involve <strong>peer review</strong> of code, so it is important that the assignments be submitted on time.</p></li>
<li><p>Optional <strong>challenge exercises</strong> will be occasionally posted. These exercises will be based on advanced concepts from previous sessions. Successful completion of a <strong>challenge exercise</strong> will earn extra credit equivalent to a <strong>weekly review exercise</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>The course project will ideally be based on student's current research. The purpose of the project is to:
<ul>
<li>Resolve pre-existing data analysis issues</li>
<li>Refine the student's current research and data analysis workflow</li>
<li>Expose the student to best practices for documentation and reproducibility</li>
<li>Practice communication of experimental design and results</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The project will have with <strong>three</strong> milestones:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Proposal</strong>: The proposal consists of two parts:
<ul>
<li>A general description of the student's current research and <em>a scope of work to be attempted</em> within the semester towards this research project.</li>
<li>In the context of your research project, identify a common frustration, existing limitation, or <em>bad habit</em> that you would like to improve on over the course of the semester. Work the instructor to develop a <em>course of action</em> to resolve the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Presentation</strong>: Starting on <strong>week 7</strong> each class will feature a student presentation. In the presentation the student will communicate:
<ul>
<li>the research question / hypothesis</li>
<li>the data analysis methods used or needed</li>
<li>describe the features of a relevant dataset to the class using exploratory data analysis</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Report</strong>: The project will culminate in a project report. The report will include all necessary code and data to reproduce the findings. The grade will be based partially on the reproduction of results, but also on style, documentation, and overall effort.</li>
</ol></li>
